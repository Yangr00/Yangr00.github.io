Hi! I am an MS student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Prior to UNC, I received my BS in Applied Mathematics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My primary research interest lies in survival analysis and causal inference. I am also interested in integrating traditional methodologies with statistical machine learning.
