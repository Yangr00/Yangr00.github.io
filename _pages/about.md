Hi! I am an MS student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Prior to UNC, I received my BS in Applied Mathematics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My primary research interests build on my experience with survival analysis, causal inference, statistical genomics, and data integration, particularly in the context of clinical trials. I aim to integrate traditional methodologies with machine learning to develop robust and interpretable models.
